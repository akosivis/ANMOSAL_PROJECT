DEC 11
+ Randomized Spawn
+ AVATAR with NAMES :)
+ Less delay
+ TESTED on 4 players
+ Modified UI so Timer is at the Bottom
+ Timer font turns red if less than 20 seconds left
- Single Round (tried implementing another round it's hard LOL)


DEC 9
+ changed the starting UI so it's less confusing
+ name added (must be at least 3 characters, any characters more than will be trunated)
+ accepts 3 players (havent tested on 4)
+ sends player's details instead of map
+ you can now see where the other players are.
+ scores still shows up
+ every client sends to port 4444, the client needs to choose (input) port that is available

- the server is still statically bound to ports 4444 and his client counterpart 4443
- delay will make the score not even on all instances
- not yet randomized spawn point
- all characters are still blank rectangles
